        <P>
             My name is Meet Sharma and I am a student at Algonquin College. I enjoy learning new skills, 
      especially in technology and creative fields. I believe that hard work and steady practice 
      can bring growth and confidence. I always try to focus on my goals and keep improving myself.

            <P>
                Outside of studies, I like reading, exploring new ideas, and helping others when they face challenges. 
      I think that sharing knowledge makes learning more meaningful. My approach is to stay positive, 
      patient, and determined, even when things donâ€™t go as planned. I treat each challenge as a chance to grow.
