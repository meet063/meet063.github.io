             My name is Meet Sharma and I am a student at Algonquin College. I enjoy learning new skills, 
      especially in technology and creative fields. I believe that hard work and steady practice 
      can bring growth and confidence. I always try to focus on my goals and keep improving myself.

            <P>
            I completed my graduation in Information System Management, where I learned the basics of VB.NET and HTML. During my studies, I also worked on a website project where I coded the entire structure, but at the time it didn’t fully run in Crome that project gave me valuable experience and inspired me to keep improving my skills.
              Currently, I am focusing on learning web development more deeply and exploring how technology can solve real-world problems. I enjoy creating projects, learning from challenges, and continuously growing as a student and future professional in the tech field.
